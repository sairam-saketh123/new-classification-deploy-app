<h2>Machine Learning Classification App</h2>

<p>
  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
  The goal of this project is to develop an interactive and robust Machine Learning Classification App that allows users to:
  
  <ul>
    
    <li>Upload datasets</li>
    <li>Preprocess the data</li>
    <li>Select from various classification models</li>
    <li>Train the models</li>
    <li>Evaluate their performance</li>
    <li>Download the trained model</li>
    
  </ul>
  The app provides visual insights through data visualization, feature importance analysis, confusion matrices, and classification reports to guide users in making informed decisions based on their dataset.
</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data Upload:</b> Support for CSV and Excel file formats.</li>
  <li><b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Handling missing values, scaling, encoding categorical data.</li>
  <li><b>Visualization:</b> Histograms, box plots, bar charts to explore and understand the dataset.</li>
  <li><b>Model Training & Evaluation:</b> Options to train models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.</li>
  <li><b>Evaluation Metrics:</b> Display of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.</li>
  <li><b>Classification Reports:</b> Detailed breakdowns of classification performance.</li>
  <li><b>Download Trained Model:</b> Users can download the trained model for further usage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>App Objective</h3>
<p>
  The primary objective of this app is to empower data scientists and machine learning practitioners by offering a streamlined workflow for classification modelingâ€”from dataset exploration and model training to evaluation and deployment.
