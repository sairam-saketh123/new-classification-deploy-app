<h2>Machine Learning Classification App</h2>

<p>
  <h3> Problem Statement</h3>

The goal of this project is to develop an interactive and robust Machine Learning Classification App that allows users to upload datasets, preprocess the data, select from various classification models, train the models, evaluate their performance, and download the trained model. The app will provide visual insights through data visualization, feature importance analysis, confusion matrices, and classification reports to guide users in making informed decisions based on their dataset.


<h3> Key Features </h3>


1) <b>Data Upload:</b> Support for CSV and Excel file formats.
   
2) <b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Handling missing values, scaling, encoding categorical data.
   
3) <b>Visualization:</b> Histograms, box plots, bar charts to explore and understand the dataset.
 
4) <b>Model Training & Evaluation:</b> Options to train models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.
   
5) <b>Evaluation Metrics:</b> Display of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
   
6) <b>Classification Reports:</b> Detailed breakdowns of classification performance.

7) <b>Download Trained Model:</b> Users can download the trained model for further usage.


<h3>App Objective</h3>

The primary objective of this app is to empower data scientists and machine learning practitioners by offering a streamlined workflow for classification modelingâ€”from dataset exploration and model training to evaluation and deployment.
