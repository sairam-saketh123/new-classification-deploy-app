<h3>Enhanced Auto ML Application</h3>
<p>
  1) This Streamlit application provides an automated machine learning (AutoML) solution for classification tasks. 
  
  2) It allows users to upload a dataset, preprocess the data, train various classification models (including Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Gradient 
     Boosting, Bagging, and Extra Trees), and evaluate their performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.
     
  3) The application includes features for data visualization, scaling, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables, all designed with a modern, dark-themed UI for an enhanced 
     user experience.
